## WELCOME
Thank you for visiting my C programming projects learnt during my software engineering program with ALX.
# Introduction
**C** is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. Also **C**, is a computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist `Dennis M. Ritchie` at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories).
# Table of Contents
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the **C language**. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

* 0x00. C - Hello, World
* 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
* 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
* 0x03. C - debugging
* 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
* 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
* 0x08. C - Recursion
* 0x09. C - Static libraries
* 0x0A. C - argc, argv
* 0x0B. C - malloc, free
* 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
* 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
* 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
* 0x0F. C - Function pointers
* 0x10. C - Variadic functions
* 0x11. C - printf
* 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
* 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
* 0x14-bit_manipulation
* 0x15-file_io

All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for the ALX-SE programme. **alx_africa** is an online full-stack software engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry using project-based peer learning.
## STAY TUNED!
* More projects are coming soon!!!
* I am on my way to be the best software engineer that I can possibly be!!!
