**_A low-level language is machine-oriented. Low-level programs are expressed in terms of the machine operations that must be performed to carry out a task._**
## WELCOMEü§ù
Thank you for visiting my C programming projects learnt during my software engineering program with ALX.
# Introduction
**C** is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners. Also **C**, is a computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by American computer scientist `Dennis M. Ritchie` at Bell Laboratories (formerly AT&T Bell Laboratories).
# Table of Contents
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at the alx-SoftwareEngineering program facilitated by ALX_Africa. I am learning about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the **[`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) language**. I update this repo with my learning progresses with hands-on projects as listed below:

## 0x00. C - Hello, World
* It aims to learn about what is entry point, basics commands (puts, printf, putchar), compilation process with gcc in **C language**

## 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
* It aims to learn about arithmetic operators, relational operators, boolean operators, comments, declaring variables and loops in **C language**

## 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
* It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language**
## 0x03. C - debugging
* It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**

## 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
* It aims to learn about nested loops in **C language**

## 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

* It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**

## 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
* It aims to learn about pointers and arrays in **C language**

## 0x08. C - Recursion
* It aims to learn about recursion and how to implement it in **C language**

 ## 0x09. C - Static libraries
* It aims to learn about static libraries in **C language**
 
## 0x0A. C - argc, argv
* It aims to learn about how to use arguments passed to a program in **C language**

## 0x0B. C - malloc, free
* It aims to learn about automatic and dynamic allocation in **C language**

## 0x0C. C - More malloc, free
* It aims to learn about how to use `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc` and `exit` functions in **C language**

## 0x0D. C - Preprocessor
* It aims to learn about how to include guard in the header files and macros in **C language**

## 0x0E. C - Structures, typedef
* It aims to learn about structures and `typedef` in **C language**

## 0x0F. C - Function pointers
* It aims to learn about function pointers in **C language**

## 0x10. C - Variadic functions
* It aims to learn about variadic functions in **C language**

## 0x11. C - printf
* It aims to learn about how to create our own `Printf Function` in **C language**

## 0x12. C - Singly linked lists
* It aims to learn about linked lists in **C language**

## 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists
* It aims to learn about singly linked lists in **C language**

## 0x14-bit_manipulation
* It aims to learn about how to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators in **C language**

## 0x15-file_io
* It aims to learn about how to handle files (open, close, read and write), file descriptors, system calls and file permissions in **C language**

## 0x17-doubly_linked_lists
It aims to learn about doubly linked list in **C language**

## 0x18-dynamic_libraries
