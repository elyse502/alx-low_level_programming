# *0x03. C - Debugging*
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly. As you become a more advanced programmer and an industry engineer, you will learn how to use debugging tools such as **gdb** or built-in tools that IDEs have. However, itâ€™s important to understand the concepts and processes of debugging manually.

## Multiple mains
**Test that function `postive_or_negative()` gives correct output when given case with 0.**
* Only change one line of code
```
i = 0;
```
## Like, comment, subscribe
**Comment out part of code that is causing infinite loop.**
```
/*
* while (i < 10)
* {
*       putchar(i);
* }
*/
```
## 0 > 972?
**Fix `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out largest number no matter the case**

## Leap year
**Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.**
* assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
* assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).
